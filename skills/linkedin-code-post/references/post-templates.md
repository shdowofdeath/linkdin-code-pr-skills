# Post Templates

## Code Showcase Template

```
{hook_line}

{problem_statement — 2-3 lines describing the problem you faced}

{approach — 2-3 lines on how you solved it}

{key_insight — 1-2 lines highlighting the most interesting technical decision}

{cta_question — 1 line asking for engagement}

{hashtags — 3-5 relevant hashtags}
```

### Field Guidelines

- **hook_line**: Attention-grabbing opener. Start with a surprising fact, a contrarian take, or a relatable pain point. Examples:
  - "I replaced 200 lines of code with 15."
  - "This one function changed how I think about error handling."
  - "Sometimes the simplest solution is the hardest to find."
- **problem_statement**: What were you trying to do? What made it hard? Keep it concrete.
- **approach**: What did you build? How does it work at a high level? Focus on the "why" behind your choices.
- **key_insight**: The one thing you'd tell another developer. A lesson, a pattern, a trick.
- **cta_question**: Ask something that invites comments. "How do you handle X?" or "What's your approach to Y?"
- **hashtags**: 3-5 hashtags. Always include #SoftwareEngineering. Add language/framework-specific tags.

## PR Review Template

```
{hook_line}

{context — 2-3 lines about the project and what this PR accomplishes}

Key changes:
{bullet_points — 3-5 bullet points summarizing the most important changes}

{lesson — 2-3 lines on what you learned or what was interesting about this work}

{takeaway — 1 line summarizing the lesson for the reader}

{hashtags — 3-5 relevant hashtags}
```

### Field Guidelines

- **hook_line**: Lead with the impact or the "so what." Examples:
  - "Just merged a PR that cuts our build time by 40%."
  - "This PR taught me more about caching than any blog post."
  - "Shipped a feature that our users have been requesting for months."
- **context**: What project? What does the PR do? Why does it matter?
- **bullet_points**: Use `->` or `-` for bullets. Each point: what changed + why. Keep each under 15 words.
- **lesson**: What surprised you? What would you do differently? What did the code review reveal?
- **takeaway**: One sentence the reader can apply to their own work.
- **hashtags**: Include #OpenSource if applicable, #CodeReview, and relevant tech tags.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Professional but conversational** -- write like you're explaining to a smart colleague over coffee
- **First person** -- "I built", "I learned", "We shipped"
- **Show vulnerability** -- mention what was hard, what you got wrong, what surprised you
- **Use line breaks liberally** -- LinkedIn rewards scannable content
- **1-3 emojis max** -- use sparingly for visual breaks, not decoration
- **Under 1300 characters total** -- LinkedIn truncates after ~210 chars with "see more"; keep the hook above that line
- **No corporate speak** -- avoid "leverage", "synergy", "best-in-class"
